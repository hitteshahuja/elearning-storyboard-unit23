Industry Statistics:
- More than 8,000 Superyachts worldwide
- Annual production rate of about 150 vessels

The term 'yacht' is defined as: 'Any watercraft which features accommodation and is used solely for pleasure, be it leisure or races or even a getaway.'

Originating from the Dutch word 'jacht' which meant to hunt or pursue, yachts were originally lightweight chasing vessels used by authorities in coastal towns. They were later used for recreational races, and the term Superyacht has become associated with large and luxurious vessels as entertainment for wealthy individuals.

Each Superyacht has a flag state where it is registered. Common flag state registrars for large yachts are Cayman Islands, Marshall Islands, Malta, Isle of Man and BVI's.`,

    content: `In yachting it is customary to use terms such as:

SIZE CLASSIFICATIONS:

- Mega Yacht: Vessels over 70M (200ft)

PROPULSION TYPES:
- Motor Yachts: Rely on engines for propulsion
- Sailing Yachts: Use wind power to move through the water

A Superyacht is an extremely luxurious sailing or motor-powered vessel, usually larger than 24m, and owned by a wealthy, high net-worth individual.

OPERATION TYPES:
- Private: Solely for the pleasure of the owner and guests. Do not carry passenger restrictions. May be used for business, meetings or functions. There is more of a personal touch to a private vessel.

- Commercial/Charter: May carry no more than 12 passengers. Charter contracts include an advance provisioning allowance (APA) - a deposit to cover operating costs such as food, fuel and berthing. Essential to provide extremely high level of customized service and professional etiquette.

- Expedition: Vessels built or converted for long distance cruising to remote parts of the world. Technical ability to conduct scientific research and marine conservation activities. Often require specialist crewmembers such as local guides, helicopter pilots, ski instructors or documentary videographers.`,

    content: `A VHF radio is a critical piece of safety equipment that should be on board every yacht. Knowing how to use it could save your life one day and those of the passengers onboard.

BASIC STEPS FOR USING VHF RADIO:
1. Turn on the VHF unit and adjust the squelch until static stops
2. Perform radio check with another unit on board (do not use channel 16)
3. Turn radio to one-watt power setting and key the microphone
4. Hold microphone 8cm from mouth, press Push-to-Talk (PTT) to transmit
5. Call "radio check" three times, followed by your call sign
6. Wait for reply confirming transmission received
7. Use channel 16 to call other ships, then switch to another channel for messages
8. For internal communications, avoid channels 06, 13, 16, 75 and 76

HOW TO CALL ANOTHER YACHT:
Switch to Ch16
Call: "Seaspray, Seaspray, this is Blue Dolphin, Blue Dolphin, Over"
Receive: "Blue Dolphin, this is Seaspray, Over"
Call: "Seaspray, this is Blue Dolphin. Suggest channel zero eight. Over"
Receive: "Blue Dolphin this is Seaspray. Change channel to zero eight. Over"
Then change to channel 08 and resume communication

EMERGENCY PROCEDURES:
- Tune to channel 16 in full power (25 watts)
- If lives are in danger: Transmit "Mayday Mayday Mayday" with vessel name and call sign
- Wait for station response, be ready with location (latitude/longitude)
- For urgent but not life-threatening: Use "PAN-PAN"

RADIO ETIQUETTE TERMINOLOGY:
- Affirmative: Yes
- Negative: No
- Received/Copy: Message heard and understood

    content: `EXPECTATIONS:
- Detail: The level of detail expected is of the highest caliber. Heavily detailed cleaning schedules will be handed to you by your Head of Interior.
- Long working hours: Life onboard is not a standard 9-5 job. You may work weekends even in off season. Watch schedules mean you cannot leave the vessel completely for 24 hours until duties are relieved. During long charters, you may not have a day off in weeks.

REMEMBER: Grit and resilience are key characteristics for any successful crew. Captains and agents try to gauge candidates' commitment to a career on yachts. They want to know you can withstand the physical demands.

ATTITUDES:
Although expectations may be tough, your overall attitude will help you stand out. It is essential that crew work in harmony to form a strong unit. When safety is at stake, each team member must do their part.

RESPECT:
Whether on private or charter yachts, vessels are busy with crew and guests. Maintain polite respect for others - both emotionally and physically. Know when to stay humble and learn from more experienced team members. Work with diligence, confidence, and purpose.

AWARENESS:
Be aware of your new surroundings from both safety and personal perspectives. Acknowledge expectations and deliver in a constructive, respectful manner to ensure positive relationships with fellow crew members.`,

The attractive remuneration package is a selling factor for crew wishing to start a career on a yacht. However, salary expectations for junior crew entering with little to no sea time must be realistic.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
Salary must not be the primary factor. What is important when looking for your first role is an opportunity to gain valuable experience ideally by a strong head of department. Many crew come into the industry with preconceived ideas about jobs and money, yet the reality is often different. Once you have experience, you can be more selective about roles and salaries.

CONTRACTS & SEA:
As a crew member, you will be asked to read a Seafarer Employment Agreement (SEA) carefully and understand the responsibilities and privacy requirements. If you do not understand any clauses, ask questions. If you do not comply, you jeopardize your employment.

WHAT MIGHT BE INCLUDED IN A CREW CONTRACT:
- Owner/Manager/Agent - Who, what and where?
- Remuneration - Salary, timing and method of payment

    content: `PUNCTUALITY:
Punctuality is one of the primary bastions of professionalism. Seafarers must be punctual in every aspect: shore-leave, reporting for watch-keeping duties. Delay of any operation can lead to delay of the whole ship, resulting in loss of time and money.

PERSONAL HABITS:

DRINKING:
Sobriety is essential. Most ship owners have prohibited alcohol consumption onboard. Where such a policy is in effect, it is mandatory to adhere to it.

DRUGS:
Narcotics are a complete no-no onboard and ashore. It is unlawful to consume, possess, or distribute drugs. A seafarer found guilty is liable to dismissal and legal proceedings. Certain countries have strict rules involving capital punishment. Transporting drugs is a guaranteed route to long imprisonment.

SMOKING:
Most ship owners follow No-Smoking policy, especially on tankers and vessels carrying flammable cargo. Designated smoking rooms are the only places where smoking is permitted.

BEHAVIOR TOWARDS COLLEAGUES:
Misbehavior and anti-social attitude are not tolerated. Actions such as abusive language, racism, sexual harassment, aggressive attitude can face suspension or discontinuation. Owing to multicultural nature, adapt to various needs and customs of different individuals.

UNAUTHORIZED PERSONNEL:
Seafarers are not allowed to bring unauthorized persons onboard. Ship and port authority rules must be strictly followed. Standing rules prohibit entry of unauthorized persons into port facility or ship.

TREATMENT OF YACHT PROPERTY:
Treat the ship like your own home. The property must be treated with respect as it is part of daily usage.

UNLAWFUL ACTIVITIES:
Actions such as assault, willful damage, persistent disobedience, endangering ship or persons, cargo theft, compromising safety can face suspension or severe actions.`,

NDAs are common in the yachting industry and sometimes included as part of contracts to maintain the owner's desire for privacy. NDAs or confidentiality clauses can be included in seafarers' employment agreement (SEA) or contained in a separate annex.

NDAs exist as part of yacht owners' desire to keep their vessel as a place of privacy. Many owners tend to be individuals of high net worth, celebrities and politicians.

TYPES OF NDAs:
- Simple NDAs: Prohibit disclosing names of owner, vessel, locations, guest details
- Detailed NDAs: Specify precise types of information not to be made public
- Social Media NDAs: Provisions about crew use of social media, photography, videos, audio clips

CONSEQUENCES OF VIOLATION:
If found in violation of an NDA, whether intentional or not, consequences usually include termination of employment. If someone is harmed, the owner could seek financial compensation.

CULTURE & DIVERSITY:
The superyacht industry has been paying closer attention to diversity and inclusion, with focus on equality and creating a more sustainable industry.

Cultural Diversity includes differences in nationality, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation and age. These contribute to and influence our behaviours, thoughts, reactions, and expectations.

For true cultural diversity, teams should understand and demonstrate cultural competence - an attribute that changes how we lead and interact with crew and guests.

Yachts need crew to develop skills in cultural awareness, cultural intelligence and cultural flexibility through training and personal development.`,

Bullying is a form of harassment that includes hostile or vindictive behavior, causing the recipient to feel threatened or intimidated. It results in a work environment where a person may become threatened because of negative or hostile behaviour.

HARASSMENT:
Harassment is a form of discrimination which has the purpose or effect of violating the dignity of a person and creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment.

REPORTING:
Bullying and harassment is never acceptable. There should be systems to ensure crew can report safely and confidentially. All employers should have clear policies for dealing with shipboard bullying and harassment.

If junior crew are unhappy with Heads of Department, they have the right to file an official complaint to the Captain. An official complaint is protection given by MLC and must be officially written and signed.

SIGNPOSTING:
If a crewmember files an official complaint and is not satisfied with response, they can make final complaint to management office or Designated Person Ashore (DPA). The correct way is to speak openly about the problem instead of gossiping.

DIET & EXERCISE:
Taking care of our physical body helps cope with emotional problems:
1. Eating healthily and regularly
2. Exercising regularly, especially outside in natural spaces
3. Making best use of rest times
4. Limiting caffeine intake

ALCOHOL, DRUGS & SUBSTANCE MISUSE:
Using alcohol and substances can block out stress feelings from demanding charters. Days off after intense trips might lead to peer pressure to celebrate excessively.

Important: If using alcohol beyond moderation or unable to control drug impulse, seek help from peer or head of department.

REST, SLEEP & RE-SET:
With high-intensity work, maximize rest hours for optimum performance.

STCW'10 REQUIREMENTS:
- Minimum 10 hours of rest in 24-hour period
- One period must be at least 6 consecutive hours
- This is compulsory and should be recorded

COMMUNICATION WITH HOME:
Social isolation and loneliness are part of life at sea. Good working conditions are extremely important. Well-being involves building positive relationships onboard and staying in touch with family and friends.

CRITICAL FRIEND & SOCIAL SUPPORT:
Social support is feeling accepted, loved or prized by others. Positive support provides protection against stress effects. Seek guidance from senior crew members when adjusting to crew life.`,

This section covers:
- Standards of Behaviour & Personal Presentation
- Knowledge of attention to detail & work ethic

3.1 STANDARDS OF BEHAVIOUR & PERSONAL PRESENTATION:

IMPORTANCE OF SELF-CARE & PERSONAL HYGIENE:
Just as with any job, appearance and cleanliness are important. There are special health considerations before embarking on your first yacht. A physically healthy person has high self-esteem, is sociable and finds it easier to motivate oneself to work.

ALWAYS LOOK PROFESSIONAL:
Whether on private or charter vessel, you represent the yacht and the owner. When on duty, be clean, neat and tidy. You will be given 2-3 uniforms including jackets and foul weather gear. Keep them clean, pressed, and ready for use.

When guests are onboard, uniform usually consists of skorts and polo shirt, changing to 'blacks' for evening service. Some companies expect epaulettes indicating rank.`,

Seafarers must be punctual in every aspect: returning from shore leave, reporting for watch-keeping. Delay of any operation can lead to delay of whole ship, resulting in loss of time and money.

REMEMBER NEATNESS COUNTS:
There is no room for bad habits on a yacht. Crew should be clean, hygienic, and courteous. If you throw clothes on floor or leave hair in shower, get rid of those habits before taking a yacht job.

IMPACT OF HUMILITY & RESPECT:
You must be a good team player. Work with people you might never have met from different countries. Be always friendly, approachable and work as a team no matter what.

Be willing to learn all the time on the job. The best skills and work ethics are learned at sea.`,

Being a good communicator helps propel your career from initial interview to first time stepping onboard.

4.1 IMPORTANCE & DIFFERENT STYLES OF EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION:

TYPES OF COMMUNICATION:

1. VERBAL COMMUNICATION:
As you grow up, you learn language spoken by those around you. You learn to express yourself and put words into context. However, there is more to verbal communication than grammar rules. The meaning depends on people and culture.

Language symbolizes only a portion of reality. The same word can have multiple meanings leading to miscommunication. Take verbal communication within context of surroundings.

2. NON VERBAL COMMUNICATION:
"The body says what words cannot" - Martha Graham

Nonverbal communication is important for effective communication. When you smile, nod or wave, you communicate non-verbally. Moving your chair closer, raising vocal volume or saying nothing are also nonverbal signals.

Using nonverbal communication effectively increases ability to send and receive signals, heightens social well-being and increases success in influencing others.

In day-to-day interactions you use both verbal and nonverbal means. It is extremely important to understand how to do so effectively.`,

    voiceoverScript: 'Clear verbal and written communication is essential for understanding others and being understood. This helps build trust and integrity within your team.',
    content: `CLEAR COMMUNICATION TECHNIQUES:

1. LISTENING:
Listening enhances ability to be understood and makes you a better communicator. It builds trust, reduces misunderstandings, eliminates conflict, builds stronger relationships, deepens friendships and increases productivity.

When listening, retain information and understand what is asked, leading to fewer misunderstandings.

2. COMMUNICATE CONFIDENTLY:
Be confident in what you want to say. Maintain eye contact, relaxed body stance, talk with concision. Do not make statements sound like questions. Avoid sounding aggressive or demeaning.

3. BUILDING RAPPORT:
Rapport is connection or relationship with someone. Employers usually hire people they feel will get on well with rest of crew, especially in intimate working environments.

Rapport happens naturally or is developed by finding common ground and being empathic.

4. EMPATHY:
Demonstrate that you can see another person's point of view. Humans are naturally empathetic but have biases from upbringing and experiences.

When talking to people from different backgrounds, commit to listening rather than assuming. Hearing from the source gives deeper understanding of perspective.

BODY LANGUAGE & FACIAL EXPRESSIONS:
- Body movements are excellent non-verbal communication
- Gestures like thumbs up express emotions
- Facial movements communicate various emotions
- Manage facial expressions to achieve desired effect

    content: `Often you will work on vessels with crew and guests of various nationalities. This can be stressful, especially sharing cabins or living in close quarters. It is important to understand and adapt to different beliefs, cultures and personalities.

As a crewmember, work as a team and treat each other with respect and courtesy. Some crew may not have English as first language; respect this language barrier.

Guest interactions can be equally complex. The standard of service is very personal and demanding. Owners or Charter Guests expect crew to adapt to their personal lifestyles which differ from culture to culture.

Your mannerisms must adapt according to guests onboard. What works on one yacht can get you fired on another:
- American Guests: Approachable and communicative
- Russian Guests: Very private, extensive communication can disturb them

5.1 A BASIC KNOWLEDGE OF DIVERSITY & CULTURES:

THE IMPORTANCE & IMPACT OF DIVERSITY & EQUALITY:
The superyacht industry has been paying closer attention to diversity and inclusion, with focus on equality and creating a more sustainable industry.

Cultural Diversity includes differences in nationality, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation and age. These contribute to and influence our behaviours, thoughts, reactions, and expectations.

For true cultural diversity, teams should understand and demonstrate cultural competence - an attribute that changes how we lead and interact.

Yachts need crew to develop skills in:
- Cultural awareness
- Cultural intelligence
- Cultural flexibility

These can be achieved through training and personal development.`,
